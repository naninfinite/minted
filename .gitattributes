# Normalise line endings
* text=auto eol=lf

# Swift and Xcode project files as text
*.swift text
*.xib text
*.storyboard text
*.plist text
*.md text

# Merge strategy for Xcode project files
*.pbxproj text merge=union

# Binary files
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.heic binary
*.xcassets binary

# Why:
# 	ensures line endings stay consistent (LF).
#	treats Swift & config files as text, so diffs are clean.
#	uses merge=union for *.pbxproj, which reduces merge conflicts when two people add files.
#	marks images and asset catalogs as binary.
