## Intent
Complete Issue #2 scaffold: set up `HealthStatsTests.swift` to fully verify clamping, adjusting helpers, neutral baseli$

## Work Log                           
- 07:15 Created `MintedTests/HealthStatsTests.swift` scaffold with summary header.
- 07:42 Implemented tests for init clamping (values <0 →  0, >100  100).
- 07:50 Added tests for adjusting helpers (upward clamps to 100, downward clamps to 0).
- 07:59 Added test confirming neutral baseline returns all 50.
- 08:06 Added boundary-band tests: average == 75 →  `.healthy`, average == 40 →  `.okay`.
- 08:07 Ran ⌘U - all tests passed. 

## Decisions
- Confirmed commit message type: `test(models): add HealthStats clamping/adjusters/neutral/boundary tests`.
- Tests remain as Logic Tests (Host Application = None).
- Explicit Boundary checks added to prevent regression if range logic changes.

## Notes  
- Clamping behaviour verified across both init and helpers.
- Tests keep deterministic, no locale or date dependencies.

## Next Session
- Move to Issue #3: implement `Plant.swift` model with matching doc/comment style.
- Add `PlantTests.swift` to cover defaults, last* computed accessors, and Codable roundtrip.
