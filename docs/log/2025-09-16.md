# 2025-09-16 - Minted Dev Diary

## Intent
Start development cleanly by setting up Git hygiene and scaffolding docs. Will add first model file (`CareEvent.swift`) later today.

## Work Log (timestamped)
- 18:54 - Initialised repo with README, LICENSE, gitignore, attributes, editorconfig, commit template.
- 19:06 - Added docs scaffolding: log template, roadmap, backlog, ADR template, notes, PR + issue templates.
- 19:19 - Wrote source-of-truth design snapshot.
- 19:24 - Linked repo to remote and confirmed GitHub backup working.
- 01:27 (next day) - Planning next step: first daily log and model file later.

## Decisions
- Commit template will always follow: Why / What changed / Tested / Next.
- Daily logs are mandatory for each working session, one file per day.
- Source-of-truth.md is the single reference for design; always updated if direction changes.

## Notes / Potential Hazards
- Remember to keep backlog "Next" list â‰¤ 4 items.
- Heredocs (`cat <<EOF`) can overwrite files if needed.

## Next Session
- [ ] Add `CareEvent.swift` (immutable care log record).
- [ ] Commit message: `feat(models): add CareEvent and CareType (immutable care log)`
